Book Log Progressive Web App
Overview
The Book Log app lets you track, rate, and manage the books youâ€™ve read. It uses Firebase Firestore for data persistence and biometric
authentication (via WebAuthn) for secure access. The app is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities and 
a responsive design.

Responsive Design:
Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
